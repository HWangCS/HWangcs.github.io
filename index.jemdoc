== About me
I am a researcher in the DSSS department at NEC Labs America.

I am a postdoc associate in the [https://cpsc.yale.edu Department of Computer Science] at [https://www.yale.edu Yale University], where I work with [https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/soule/ Prof. Robert Soule] and [https://codex.cs.yale.edu/avi/ Prof. Avi Silberschatz].

I received my Ph.D. at [https://www.virginia.edu University of Virginia], advised by [http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~hs6ms/ Prof. Helen Shen]. Also, I received my B.S. at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Science_and_Technology_of_China University of Science & Technology of China (USTC)] and M.S. at [http://www.columbia.edu/ Columbia University]. I am very fortunate to work with a number of wonderful people. 

=== Research
I'm interested in AI Agent, LLM, Cloud and Distributed systems, especially in Multi Agent System, LLM Agent, Reinforcement Learning, Simulation, Distributed Systems and Datacenter Networks.
