== About me
I am a researcher in the [https://www.nec-labs.com/research/data-science-system-security/ Data Science and System Security (DSSS)] department at NEC Labs America in Princeton, NJ. 
My research focuses on building scalable and resilient systems for the next generation of AI.

Previously, I was a Postdoc Associate in the [https://cpsc.yale.edu Department of Computer Science] at [https://www.yale.edu Yale University], working with [https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/soule/ Prof. Robert Soule] and [https://codex.cs.yale.edu/avi/ Prof. Avi Silberschatz].

I received my Ph.D. from the [https://www.virginia.edu University of Virginia], advised by [http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~hs6ms/ Prof. Helen Shen]. 
I obtained my M.S. from [http://www.columbia.edu/ Columbia University] and B.S. from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Science_and_Technology_of_China USTC].
